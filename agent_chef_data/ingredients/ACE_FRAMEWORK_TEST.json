    "output":"The Aspirational Layer in the ACE Framework serves as the ethical compass for the autonomous agent. It provides animating imperatives, moral judgments, and ethical decisions to guide the agent's behavior. The Aspirational Layer contains a constitution with three key components: 1) Heuristic Imperatives, which are broad ethical goals like reducing suffering, 2) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which reinforces human values and needs, and 3) A Mission Statement with high-level objectives specific to the agent's purpose. This layer processes inputs from lower layers and issues moral judgments, mission objectives, and ethical decisions onto the southbound bus to shape the agent's cognition across all abstraction levels.",

    "output":"The Global Strategy Layer in the ACE Framework integrates real-world environmental context into the agent's strategic planning and decision-making processes. It maintains an ongoing internal model of the state of the broader environment outside of the agent by gathering and analyzing sensory information from external sources. This layer takes the aspirational mission set by the upper Aspirational Layer and refines it by incorporating relevant details about the agent's current environmental context. It outputs a set of potential strategies or approaches for achieving the aspirational mission within the context of the current world state, as well as principles that support or constrain the proposed strategic direction. By passing this environmentally grounded strategic guidance to lower layers, the Global Strategy Layer enables the agent to pursue globally-defined goals through locally-relevant approaches tailored to its immediate circumstances.",
